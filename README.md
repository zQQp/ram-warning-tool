Simple Application written in C# .NET 4.0 for Windows to display current RAM usage and warn when it goes over 90%.

Purpose:
When using unstable or modded applications / games that have memory leaks, the computer crashes when ram gets full.
To prevent data loss, i created this program for myself to run in the background and warn, before it is too late.
So you can simply save your progress, exit the application / game and rerun and load again.

I personally dont like applications that throw me out of my current application so this notifies over the speakers when ram is to full with speech synthesis.

"Warning, your RAM has reached over 90% usage!"

Editor and Compiler used: VisualStudio Express 2015
